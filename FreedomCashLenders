Payday loans are short-term loans that must be repaid by your next payday. They typically don't require a credit check, making them easy to qualify for, and they offer instant or same-day approvals. Loan amounts are lowâ€”typically in amounts of $500 or less. To guarantee repayment, borrowers provide a postdated check or authorize an automatic withdrawal when your paycheck or monthly government benefits deposit arrives.

There are no universal laws that define payday loans, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (FreedomCashLenders). State laws vary, but many payday lenders operate online to get around strict regulations.

Payday loans generally come with extremely high APRs, often exceeding 400%.2 Because payday loans are due in one lump sum, many borrowers struggle with repayment and fall into a debt cycle.
