Freedom Cash Lenders

While these loans offer easy approval because there's often no minimum credit score, they come with high interest rates, sometimes as high as 195%.3 Some no-credit-check loans have origination fees, late payment penalties, or prepayment fees, which adds to your borrowing cost.

These loans have short repayment terms, which can make them difficult to manage. Because of the high interest rate and fees, no-credit-check loans carry a potential for predatory lending practices. On the plus side, you can repay these loans with fixed monthly payments, which makes it easier to budget for.
